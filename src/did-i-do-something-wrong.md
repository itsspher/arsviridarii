sometimes you'll do something you think is nice or kind to someone, and they react with hostility. when that happens, you end up opening yourself to all sorts of emotional attacks, from that person and from yourself.

you might wonder "what did i do wrong? am i at fault? am i the bad person here?" these questions, while natural, are not the way forward.

realize that there are things you don't know and don't see. the person you attempted to be kind towards might have seen something you don't. now, whether or not what they saw was correct, is none of your business to know. the natural questions you ask yourself are not what you should be asking. instead, ask yourself this:
with what I knew at the time, and only with that information, did I do the reasonable thing?
you will find that most of the time, you did do the reasonable thing. if in reflection, you realize that you were indeed at fault, then take it as a lesson and move forward. after all, faults of the past are things you can't control, but you can always learn from them to do better in the future.
